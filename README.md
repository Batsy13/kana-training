## Kana Training

A React-based Japanese Kana (Hiragana/Katakana) quiz app with a spaced repetition system

<img width="1919" height="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33709f60-4dd5-4cfb-a568-7e8dc72ebf45" />


### Overview

Kana Training is a web application designed to help users learn and memorize the Japanese Hiragana and Katakana alphabets. It features an adaptive quiz where users match Kana characters to their Romaji equivalents.

To optimize learning, the app utilizes a spaced repetition system (SRS), which prioritizes characters with lower scores to appear more frequently. New character sets are progressively unlocked as the user demonstrates mastery.
